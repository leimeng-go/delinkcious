# Delinkcious

A delicious-like link management platform implemented using Go microservices and deployed on Kubernetes.

The book [Hands-on Microservices with Kubernetes](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Microservices-Kubernetes-scalable-microservices/dp/1789805465) describes how it was built from scratch.

# Directory Structure

## pkg
The core logic is implemented by libraries in this directory

## svc

The microservices are in this directory. They use the excellent [go-kit](https://gokit.io) microservice framework.

## cmd

Various utilities and one-time commands live here

## pb

Stands for protobuf. Contains gRPC contracts and generated code.

## fun

Serverless functions (Nuclio)

# Unit testing

Go to Delinkcious root directory and type: `ginkgo -r`
